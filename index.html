<p class="prgph">I am Solly T. Moiketoa a bachelor of Engineering graduate from University of Pretoria, South Africa. Why engineering ? Because I was good in maths and science and I wanted to further my studies with them.<br/><br/>I majored in mining engineering, It is a story to be discussed one day. It was through self development and independent learning that I chose to master myself in front-end developer role.<br/><br/> I find that the ability to learn is one of my greatest strengths. This is supported by the great research skills and methodologies that I have accumulated through out the undergraduate programme.

<p>A <i>tutoring website</i>. The website is developed specifically for parents that want to help their kids get good marks they desire in maths and science subjects. The website is designed to say we have a helping hand when needed through a slide animation <a href="#">explore tutor</a> without dismissing parents efforts.<br/><br/>The coding languages mastered in this project are <b>HTML5</b> and <b>CSS3</b>. This also include responsive web designs.</p><br/>
An input form is used for the log in and registering pages but the site uses javascript to say we are not ready to process the data.
